      <h1>Lets know about Socratic method....</h1>
      <p>The Socratic Method is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between </p>
      <p>individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical </p>
      <p>thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. Named after </p>
      <p>classical Greek philosopher Socrates, it is a pedagogical approach that </p>
      <p>empowers the learner to express knowledgeable opinions on a topic and then </p>
      <p>challenges them to further justify their positions.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The dialectical method, a core component of the Socratic Method, involves</p>
      <p>two or more people holding different points of view about a topic, who agree</p>
      <p>to use reasoned arguments to resolve their differences. This method can be </p>
      <p>broken down into several key elements:</p>
      <br>
      <p>| ~> Questioning: The process starts with a series of questions designed to clarify </p>
      <p>thoughts, definitions, and implications of the subject matter.</p>
      <p>| ~> Answering: The participants provide answers based on their current understanding</p>
      <p>or belief system.</p> 
      <p>| ~> Refutation: Through further questioning, inconsistencies or contradictions in the</p>
      <p>answers are brought to light, compelling the participants to reevaluate their positions.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Socratic Method is not only about acquiring knowledge—it’s about enhancing one’s critical</p>
      <p>thinking abilities. Through this method, individuals learn to:</p>
      <br>
      <p>Analyze concepts: Breaking down complex ideas into simpler parts for better understanding.</p>
      <p>Challenge assumptions: Questioning the validity of commonly held beliefs or opinions.</p>
      <p>Develop reasoning: Forming logical connections between ideas and arguments.</p>
      <p>Embrace uncertainty: Being comfortable with not having all the answers and remaining open to new perspectives.</p>
